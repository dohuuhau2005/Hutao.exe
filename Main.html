                                        enjoying the local delicacies in front of&nbsp;Xinyue Kiosk, not too far from
                                        the ministry building. One day, some city folk came to play with the

                                        peculiarities. Met with befuddled gazes of the bystanders, Hu Tao showed
                                        unwavering confidence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

                                        at around midnight. Initially, the guards suspected that it had been a thief
                                        preparing to rob officials. To their unceasing surprise, it would turn out to
